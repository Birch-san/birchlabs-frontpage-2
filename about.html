				<h1>Birchlabs.co.uk</h1>
				<h2><small>Purpose</small></h2>
				<p>Birchlabs presents the hobby projects of Alex and Jamie Birch.</p>
				<p>Mostly these include the Flash games that we built during our childhood.
				We also make:

					<li>Blog posts</li>

				</ul>
				<h2><small>History</small></h2>
				<p>Birchlabs.co.uk's first incarnation was as a simple HTML-only website in 1998. As the site grew better, so did its content. Proper games were introduced - ones made in Flash, which could interact with the user's mouse and keyboard.
				</p>
    			<p>They started off basic. Stick Shoot was comprised of cleverly-placed buttons and animations, but had no real engine. The Box and Cave Escape were challenging endurance games, but still used very basic code.
    			</p>
    			<p>As time went on, these games started to get more and more advanced. Invasion 1 got a Daily 5th Place Award on Newgrounds. Invasion 3 got a Daily 2nd Place and over 79,000 views, thanks to the artwork of Kortex (wildfiredesigns.net).
    			</p>
    			<p>But the Invasion series left much to be desired. For a strategy game, it wasn't as tactical as it should've been. We started to work on Commando instead.
    			</p>
    			<p>Starting as a simple battle simulator, Commando grew into a very advanced RTS, with Commando 2 getting Daily 5th Place and 39,000+ views on Newgrounds, and Commando 3 being our first Newgrounds Daily Feature, with over 140,000 views and 10,000 lines of code.
    			</p>
    			<p>The Birchlabs.co.uk of today continues to archive our legacy of Flash games. The plain-text site redesign will enable mobile users to enjoy the website.
    			</p>
    			<p>My favourite game here is Commando 3; it implements a powerful RTS mechanics despite being a "coffee break" game. Invasion 5 is the most technically interesting game here (see <a href="experiments.html">Experiments</a>).
